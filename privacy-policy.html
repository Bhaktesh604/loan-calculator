            <p>The privacy of our visitors at loancheckercalculator.site is very important to us.</p>

            <hr>

            <p>As with most other websites, we collect and use the data contained in log files. The information in the
                log files includes your IP (Internet Protocol) address, your ISP (Internet Service Provider), the
                browser you use to visit our site (such as Chrome, Safari, or Firefox), the time you visited our site,
                and the pages you visited throughout our site.</p>

            <hr>

            <p>Keep in mind that we may use cookies to store information, such as your personal preferences when you
                visit our site. This could include showing certain popups, remembering your preferences for loan
                calculations, or enabling login features for your account. We never sell your personal information to
                third parties.</p>

            <hr>

            <p>We also serve third-party advertisements on loancheckercalculator.site to support our site. Some of these

                your IP address, your ISP, the browser you used to visit our site, and sometimes additional data. This
                is generally used for geo-targeting purposes or showing relevant ads based on your activity on our site
